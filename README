Library to access Betfair API. Uses Savon SOAP library instead of Soap4R. Not sure if its faster yet, I will do some speed tests shortly.

==========
To install
==========

gem install betfairapi-savon

In an IRB console:

require 'rubygems'
require 'betfairapi-savon'	
api = BetfairAPI.new
response = api.login('username', 'password', 82, 0, 0, nil)
session_token = response.to_hash[:login_response][:result][:header][:session_token]
api.keep_alive(session_token)
api.logout(session_token)

I have only added various method calls that I need to this gem, see the /lib/betfairapi-savon.rb for the method calls available. 

They are pretty easy an obvious, see the BetfairSportsExchangeAPIReferenceGuidev6.pdf file for more info or to add your own methods.

Feel free to add more if you like and send me a pull request.
